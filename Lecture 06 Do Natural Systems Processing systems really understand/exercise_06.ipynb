Roughly, non-empirical, conceptual reflection to answer questions of meaning and sense and empirical methods to answer questions of truth. Note that it is not necessary, but often efficient, to have different persons and departments use these different methods to answer these questions. "

        "1.   **Behaviorism**: If the machine's linguistic behavior is indistinguishable from the behavior of a competent human speaker, then the machine understand language. The Turing test presupposes such a behaviorist conception of understanding.\n",
        "2.   **Biologism**: Unless the machine has structures of equal causal powers to the brain, it cannot understand language, regardless of how impressive its linguistic behavior is. To assess understanding so conceived, you need to analyse the architecture of the machine in question.\n",
        "3. **Social Recognitionism**: Whether a machine understands a language depends on whether we, as competent speakers, treat the machine as such. To test understanding on this conception, one needs to experiment with the way humans socially interact with the machine in question.\n",
        "4. **Behaviorism Plus Autonomous Learning**: A machine can be said to understand language if it performs at human parity (or reasonably close) at sufficiently sophisticated tasks and has (like humans) aquired this capacity in a process of autonomous learning, allowing it to quickly adapt (like humans) to novel challenges. To test this conception of understanding, you would have to submit the machine to sophisticated challenges and verify that it learns sufficiently autonomously.\n",
