    "# Exercise 6: Neuroinformatics - Bridging Machine Learning and Neuroscience\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, students, to the exercise of on Neuroinformatic. In this markdown document, we'll explore the captivating intersection of Machine Learning and Neural Biology, specifically focusing on Synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to Expect\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this document, you'll encounter questions that explore the intricate realm of neural biology. From understanding the brain's role in intelligence to examining the behavior of neurons and their response curves, our goal is to provide a holistic view of this subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use this Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the following 10 markdown cells contains a question regarding Neuroinformatics, please write your answer directly in the cell. Further, cells require inserting a picture into the notebook. When working with images in this notebook, if you run a cell that displays an image and then save and hand in the ipynb file, the image will be embedded directly into the notebook as part of the output. This means that anyone who opens the ipynb file will see the embedded image as part of the notebook's content, and there's no need to upload the image separately or rely on external file paths or URLs."
