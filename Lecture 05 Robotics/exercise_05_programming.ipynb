    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we are going to train a neural network policy for inverted pendulum using reinforcement learning. \n",
    "The inverted pendulum swingup problem is based on the classic problem in control theory. The system consists of a pendulum attached at one end to a fixed point, and the other end being free. The pendulum starts in a random position and the goal is to apply torque on the free end to swing it into an upright position, with its center of gravity right above the fixed point. The diagram below specifies the coordinate system used for the implementation of the pendulum's dynamic equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Space\n",
    "The action is a `ndarray` with shape `(1,)` representing the torque applied to free end of the pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Num | Action | Min  | Max |\n",
    "|-----|--------|------|-----|\n",
    "| 0   | Torque | -2.0 | 2.0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observation Space\n",
    "The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(3,)` representing the x-y coordinates of the pendulum's free\n",
    "end and its angular velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Num | Observation      | Min  | Max |\n",
    "|-----|------------------|------|-----|\n",
    "| 0   | x = cos(theta)   | -1.0 | 1.0 |\n",
    "| 1   | y = sin(theta)   | -1.0 | 1.0 |\n",
    "| 2   | Angular Velocity | -8.0 | 8.0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward function is defined as:\n",
    "$$r = -(theta^2 + 0.1 * \\hat{theta}^2 + 0.001 * torque^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the pendulum's angle normalized between $[-pi, pi]$ (with 0 being in the upright position).\n",
    "\n",
    "(You don't need to define the reward. It is provided by the OpenAI Gym environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting State\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting state is a random angle in *[-pi, pi]* and a random angular velocity in *[-1,1]*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Episode Truncation\n",
    "The episode truncates at 200 time steps."
