    "In this task, we are going to train a neural network policy for inverted pendulum using reinforcement learning. \n",
    "The inverted pendulum swingup problem is based on the classic problem in control theory. The system consists of a pendulum attached at one end to a fixed point, and the other end being free. The pendulum starts in a random position and the goal is to apply torque on the free end to swing it into an upright position, with its center of gravity right above the fixed point. The diagram below specifies the coordinate system used for the implementation of the pendulum's dynamic equations.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward function is defined as:\n",
    "$$r = -(theta^2 + 0.1 * \\hat{theta}^2 + 0.001 * torque^2)$$\n",
